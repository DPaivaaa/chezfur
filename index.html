            Chez Fur welcomes you to come by for coffee and snacks. Stay to be entertained by our 
            furry hosts as they play on our outdoor Katio or indoor Kitty Kondo, While some of our
            hosts may be a bit shy, others are happy to greet you with a request for a head scratch 
            or gentle pet. Just let them lead the way! Sit back and enjoy the company of the cats. 
            You may tind that one of our cuddly kitties would like to adopt you.
